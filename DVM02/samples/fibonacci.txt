# This is a fibonacci implementation for Dave's second virtual machine (DVM02).

# First, initialize a nop slide for "registers". Note that
# the first one is required, as address 0 is used by the
# VM to store the program counter. Instead of documenting everything, We're
# now using jump labels, even for things that we won't be using for jumps.

# Initialisation: Loop counter and accumulators
    SET loopcount 30
    SET acc1       1

    ADD temp @acc2

    SUB loopcount 1

# Jump to beginning of the loop, unless the counter is zero.
    JNZ loop @loopcount

# If the counter was zero, the jump didn't happen, and the program
# must end.
